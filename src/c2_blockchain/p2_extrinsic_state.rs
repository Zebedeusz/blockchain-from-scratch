//! Now that we have a functioning hash-linked data structure, we can use it to actually
//! track some state. Here we will start to explore the idea of extrinsics and state by
//! slightly abusing the header's extrinsics_root and state_root fields. As the names imply,
//! these are typically used for Merkle roots of large data sets. But in our case we will use
//! these fields to directly contain a single extrinsic per block, and a single piece of state.
//!
//! In the coming parts of this tutorial, we will expand this to be more real-world like and
//! use some real batching.
